### ---PLUTONIUM LAN---
Set of batch scripts to launch Plutonium in LAN mode without using an account.

### Instalation:
 1 - [Download the latest version](https://github.com/M4RCK5/Plutonium-LAN/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
 
 2 - Move "Plutonium GAME_NAME.bat" to the game folder.
 
 3 - Run "Plutonium GAME_NAME.bat".
 
 4 - Change the player name.
 
 5 - Launch the game.

PD: 
* It has an little menu that allows you to change and save a player name.
* You can run multiple instances of the game with plutonium so u can try to do some splitscreen matches using tools like UniversalSplitScreen or NucleousCoop.
* Its fully portable and will not interfere with your normal Plutonium install.
* T5 doesnt allow conections trough the console using IP so this script will only allow offline play.
* The script updates the Plutonium version for every game except T6 (r2905 needed to connect trough IP).
* Plutonium Updater comes from [here](https://github.com/mxve/plutonium-updater.rs).
* It also installs "TeknoMW3 Coop" and "Bot Warfare IW5/T4".
